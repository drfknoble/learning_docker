# 02_automated_builds

## Introduction

In this tutorial, I will show you how to create a Docker image and use it to deploy a simple app.

## Directory Structure

```console
app/
    Dockerfile
    app
src/
    CMakeList.txt
    main.cpp
```

`myapp/` contains the Dockerfile used to create an image and the app we want to distribute in the image. `src/` contains the app's CMakelist.txt and its source code.

## App

The app were building and deploying is a very simple application. Here's its source code:

```C++
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

When run, it will display the following output:

```console
Hello World!
```

## Build and Run Instructions

To build the app, type the following into the terminal:

```console
cd src
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
This will:
- Change the current directory to `src`,
- Make a subdirectory `build`,
- Change the current directory to `build`,
- Generate the CMake cache,
- Build the application.

To run the app, type the following into the terminal:

```console
./myapp
```

Afterwards, something similar to the following will be displayed:

```console
Hello World!
```

## Build Image and Run Container

To build the docker image, type the following into the terminal:

```console
cd myapp
docker build --tag drfknoble/02automatedbuilds:latest .
```

Afterwards, something similar to the following will be displayed:

```console

To run the docker container, type the following into the terminal:

```console
docker run drfknoble/02automatedbuilds:latest
```

Afterwards, something similar to the following will be displayed:

```console
Hello World!
```

## Pushing to Docker Hub

To push the image to Docker Hub, type the following into the terminal:

```console
docker push drfknoble/02automatedbuilds:latest
```

Afterwards, something similar to the following will be displayed:

```console
The push refers to repository [docker.io/drfknoble/02automatedbuilds]

```

The image is now available to be downloaded from Docker Hub.
